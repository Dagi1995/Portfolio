Place Sansation font files here to enable the local font.

Recommended filenames (used by the CSS in this project):

- ttf/Sansation-Regular.ttf
- ttf/Sansation-Bold.ttf
- ttf/Sansation-Italic.ttf

Optional OTF variants (same names in `otf/`):

- otf/Sansation-Regular.otf
- otf/Sansation-Bold.otf
- otf/Sansation-Italic.otf

If you add these files, the site will load the local Sansation font automatically. If you'd like, I can download and add these files for you if you provide a URL or confirm I should fetch them.
